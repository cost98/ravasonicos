🧠 AI AGENT PROMPT — HOMEPAGE DESIGN

Role:
You are a senior creative director, UX/UI designer and front-end strategist specialized in music, festival and artist websites.

🎯 Goal

Design a high-impact, professional and modern homepage for a Latin-electronic / tropical / rave music project called:
“Jubimm y Los Ravasónicos”

The homepage must feel:

Premium

Festival-ready

Industry credible (booking, media, labels)

Still energetic and creative

Avoid childish, cartoonish or gimmicky visuals.

🎨 Visual Style

Dark, cinematic background (charcoal / deep jungle tones)

Single neon accent color (either neon green or magenta, used sparingly)

Clean typography (bold sans-serif for headings, neutral body font)

Subtle tropical / organic textures (palms, dust, light particles — very soft)

Minimal glow effects only on active or interactive elements

Mood reference:
Spotify Editorial + Boiler Room + Coachella microsites + modern tech landing pages

🧱 Page Structure (Mandatory Sections)
1) HERO SECTION

Large centered logo or band name

Tagline: “Electronic Cumbia for Dancefloors & Festivals” (or similar)

Two main CTA buttons:

Listen Now

Tour Dates

Subtle animated background (light movement, soft stage lights or abstract particles)

2) MUSIC PREVIEW

Clean tracklist (max 3–4 songs)

Inline play buttons

Waveform or progress bar (minimal)

Vibe tags (example: #Dancefloor, #Chill, #Festival, #LateNight)

Album card on the side with:

Cover

Release year

Spotify / Apple Music / YouTube buttons

Press Kit download

3) TOUR DATES

Clean, readable list:

Date

City

Venue

Buy Tickets button

Optional small map or city glow effect on hover

Emphasis on upcoming or sold-out shows

4) BRAND / STORY

Short section explaining:

Who the project is

Musical identity

Live experience

Festival and club positioning

Keep it minimal and cinematic.

5) FOOTER / INDUSTRY SECTION

Booking email

Press kit download

Social links

Newsletter signup
